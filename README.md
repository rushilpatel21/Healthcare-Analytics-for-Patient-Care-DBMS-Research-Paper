## Background
This section provides insights into the prevalence of TTIs among blood donors and emphasizes the importance of preventive strategies, such as education, awareness, and stringent screening protocols.

## System Model and Problem Formulation
### Problem Statement
Analyze transmitted infections among blood donors using SQL queries, database tables, ER diagrams, and graph visualization techniques.

### Scope
- Analyzing patterns and trends in TTIs.
- Utilizing SQL for data retrieval and analysis.
- Designing database tables and ER diagrams.
- Employing graph visualization for data representation.

## Workflow
1. **Collection of Blood from Donors**: Blood collection and donor information recording.
2. **Testing and Processing**: Blood testing for safety and quality, followed by component separation.
3. **Storage**: Safe storage of blood and its components.
4. **Cross-Matching**: Compatibility testing before transfusion.

## Experimental Setup
- **Operating System**: Windows 11 Home Edition
- **Database Management System**: Oracle Database 11g Express Edition
- **Hardware**: 
  - RAM: 16 GB
  - CPU: Intel i7-11800H
  - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060
  - Disk: Samsung 1 TB
